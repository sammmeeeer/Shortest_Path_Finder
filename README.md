# Shortest Path Finder using BFS Algorithm

This Python script implements a shortest path finder using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph.

## How it Works

The BFS algorithm starts at the initial node and explores all of its neighbors before moving on to the next level of neighbors. This process continues until the target node is reached. As BFS explores all neighbors of a node before moving on to the next level, it guarantees the shortest path between the initial and target nodes.

## Features

- Finds the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph.
- Supports both directed and undirected graphs.
- Accepts user input for the graph structure and start/end nodes.
- Prints the shortest path from the start node to the end node.

## Usage

1. **Install Python:**
   - Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd shortest-path-finder
